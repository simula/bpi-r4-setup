#  Banana Pi BPI-R4 Setup

This repository contains documentation and code regarding the Banana Pi BPI-R4. The BPI-R4 is a multi-purpose router-board for different kinds of experiments (smart home setups, internet robustness, etc.). It is meant to support reproducible research: By documenting the settings, software and configuration for experiments, they results become reproduceable.

As of today, experiments based on the Banana Pi BPI-R4 are in a very early stage. Simula has not published any works that refer to experimental results based on the BPI-R4-platform.

For the time being, the [wiki](https://github.com/simula/bpi-r4-setup/wiki) serves as small, non-structured knowledgebase: It refers to resources that are relevant for prototyping the BPI-R4.
